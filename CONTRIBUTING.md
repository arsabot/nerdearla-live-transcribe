## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (the codebase uses `X | None` union syntax)
- **Git**
- A microphone-capable browser for manual testing (Chrome or Edge recommended)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd realtime-stt-translator

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# Install runtime + dev dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set at least APP_PASSWORD
```

Verify everything works:

```bash
# Run the test suite
pytest

# Quick syntax check
python -m compileall app tests

# Start the dev server
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --reload
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with a category prefix:

```
feat/add-deepl-translation
fix/websocket-reconnect-loop
docs/update-api-reference
refactor/extract-audio-worklet
test/elevenlabs-happy-path
```

### Making Changes

1. Create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature main
   ```
2. Make your changes in small, focused commits.
3. Run the test suite and fix any failures before pushing.
4. Push your branch and open a pull request.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (quick, quiet output — configured in pytest.ini)
pytest

# Verbose output
pytest -vv

# Run a single test file
pytest tests/test_main.py

# Run a specific test by name
pytest tests/test_main.py::test_ws_translates_text

# Run tests matching a substring
pytest -k translate

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Known test issues:** Three Deepgram-related tests (`test_ws_deepgram_happy_path_emits_interim_and_final`, `test_ws_deepgram_init_failure_sends_error`, `test_ws_deepgram_missing_sdk_returns_error`) may hang due to threading/SDK interactions. If you are working on Deepgram code, run these tests individually and be prepared to terminate them manually if they hang.

### Linting and Formatting

No linter is pinned in the project yet. If you have them installed:

```bash
# Ruff (recommended)
ruff check .
ruff format .

# mypy (optional — expect some noise from googletrans/deepgram typing)
mypy app
```

Keep formatting changes minimal and local. Avoid sending PRs that reformat entire files without functional changes.

## Code Style

### Python

- **Naming:** `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants. Use a leading underscore for internal helpers (`_translate`, `_sign`).
- **Imports:** Group with blank lines between: stdlib, third-party, local.
- **Strings:** Prefer f-strings over `str.format()`.
- **Type hints:** Use `X | None` union syntax (Python 3.10+). Add explicit return types for non-trivial helpers. Use `TypedDict` for JSON payload shapes.
- **Error handling:** Prefer specific exceptions. Use broad `except Exception` only at outer boundaries (WebSocket loops, optional imports, translation calls).
- **Logging:** Log actionable context. Never log secrets (passwords, API keys, auth tokens).

### FastAPI / WebSocket Patterns

- Keep route handlers small; push logic into helper functions.
- WebSocket endpoints must:
  1. Validate auth and origin **before** calling `accept()`.
  2. Send structured JSON errors (`{"error": "..."}`) when possible.
  3. Close with appropriate codes (`1008` for policy/unauthorized, `1011` for server error).
- Treat `send`/`close` failures as best-effort (wrap in try/except).

### Async Code

- **Never block the event loop.** If a library call is sync-only, offload with `asyncio.to_thread(...)`.
- Apply timeouts with `asyncio.wait_for(...)`.
- When receiving events from other threads, use `loop.call_soon_threadsafe(...)`.
- Catch `asyncio.CancelledError` during shutdown paths.

### Templates / Frontend

- Templates are Jinja HTML (`app/templates/*.html`) with inline CSS and inline JS.
- Keep accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, roles, skip links).
- Avoid large formatting-only diffs in HTML/CSS/JS.
- Use `textContent` / `createTextNode` instead of `innerHTML` to prevent XSS.
- Wrap all `JSON.parse` calls in try/catch in WebSocket `onmessage` handlers.

## Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

<optional body>
```

**Types:**

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build process, CI, dependencies |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace (no logic change) |

**Examples:**

```
feat(stt): add ElevenLabs Scribe v2 Realtime engine
fix(ws): prevent stale interim translations from blocking finals
docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md and issue templates
perf: throttle interim translations to prevent queue buildup
```

- Keep the first line under 72 characters.
- Use the imperative mood ("add", not "added" or "adds").
- Reference issues when applicable: `Fixes #42`.

## Pull Requests

1. **One concern per PR.** Don't mix features, bug fixes, and refactors in the same PR.
2. **Write a clear description.** Explain *what* changed and *why*.
3. **Include tests** for new functionality or bug fixes when feasible.
4. **Ensure tests pass** before requesting review.
5. **Keep diffs minimal.** Avoid unrelated formatting changes.
